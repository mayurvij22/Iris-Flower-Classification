Iris Flower Classification
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples with four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify an Iris flower species based on these features.
